     <h1>Hi, my name is Tobias B. Grun,</h1>
     <p>I am a research scientist with a deep passion for data science, statistical analysis, and programming. My journey with data began during my career as a marine scientist, where I discovered the power of data as a tool for understanding environmental patterns and processes. Over time, I shifted my focus towards data analysis, and programming became an essential part of both my work and personal projects, such as this portfolio and home automation systems with Raspberry Pi. To deepen my skills, I pursued advanced training in Machine Learning, further fueling my enthusiasm for data science.</p>
