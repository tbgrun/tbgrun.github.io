     <h1>Hi, my name is Tobias B. Grun</h1>
     <p>I am a research scientist with a deep passion for data science, statistical analyses, and programming. My affinity to data analysis started early in my career as a marine scientist, where I discovered the power of data as a tool for understanding environmental patterns and processes. Statistical programming became my happy place and over time I consequently shifted my work towards data analyses, and programming became an essential part of both my work and personal projects, such as developing websites like this portfolio, and home automation systems with Raspberry Pi. To deepen my skills, I pursued advanced training in Machine Learning, which further fueled my enthusiasm for data science.</p>
