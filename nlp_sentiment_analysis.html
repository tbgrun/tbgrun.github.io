     <h1 id="overview">NLP Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews</h1>
     <p>This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews from the Yelp Open Dataset. 
        The goal is to classify individual reviews as positive, neutral, or negative based on customer sentiment, and then aggregate these sentiments at the 
        business or store level. By analyzing sentiment trends, the project aims to identify key areas for improvement and predict potential impacts on sales and 
        customer satisfaction.</p>

        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>    
        <p>Understanding customer sentiment is essential for businesses focused on improving their services and remaining competitive. Reviews offer valuable 
            insights into customer experiences. By systematically analyzing and quantifying this sentiment data, businesses can identify areas for improvement 
            that enhance customer satisfaction. In industries where customer feedback holds significant influence, such as dining, hospitality, and retail, 
            sentiment analysis becomes a strategic tool for targeted improvements to stay competitive by increasing customer satisfaction narrowing the gap between 
            the business' Current Value and Unrealized Value.</p>
        <p>The scope of this project includes extracting, processing, and analyzing customer reviews from Yelp's Open Dataset. The analysis focuses 
            on sentiment classification into positive, neutral, or negative reviews and aggregating these sentiments to gain insights at the store level. 
            Additionally, I am exploring predictive analyses to identify potential areas of improvements based on the sentiment profile to enhance customer 
	    engagement and sales performance.</p>

        <p><a href="assets/images/sites/nlp_sentiment_analysis/persona.png" alt="Persona description" class="openModal" id="modal-content-full">Lorena Castillo</a> is the new Regional Manager for First Watch Restaurants in Florida. After taking over the Florida branches from her predecessor, she discovered 
            that the restaurant health documentation was inadequate and customer and employee satisfaction analyses were outdated. To develop a meaningful strategy, she 
            first needed a clear overview of the current status of the restaurants under her management. While reviewing numerous online reviews, she quickly became 
            overwhelmed by the sheer volume and lack of structure. Lorena decided to outsource the analysis to a reliable service provider. Given the straightforward nature 
            of the project and the need for quick results, she reached out to five consulting firms.</p>
        <p>As a result of my clear, transparent, and problem-focused proposal, Lorena awarded the contract to my firm.</p>

        <h1 id="data">Data | <span class="provided-by">provided by</span> <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank" class="inline-image"><img src="assets/images/sites/nlp_sentiment_analysis/yelp_logo.png" alt="yelp.com" /></a></h1>
        <p>In this project, I am using customer review data provided by <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank" alt="yelp.com">Yelp</a>. 
            Yelp offers two methods of data access: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset" target="_blank" alt="Yelp Open Dataset">Yelp Open Dataset</a> and 
		<a href="https://www.fusion.yelp.com" target="_blank" alt="Yelp Fusion API">Yelp Fusion</a>.</p>
        <p>Yelp Fusion <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> provides real-time data but imposes several restrictions. Customer reviews are 
            limited in both the number of requests that can be made per day and the number of characters in each review. Additionally, data retrieved through 
            <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> can only be cached for 24 hours, and the process of retrieving data can be time-consuming. 
            These limitations can complicate data analysis, especially when it is important to use the same dataset for maintaining reproducibility throughout the project.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, I have chosen to use Yelp’s Open Dataset, which is publicly and freely accessible through 
            <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download" target="_blank" alt="Yelp's Open Dataset Download">Yelp Open Data Download</a> site. Yelp generously provides the Open 
	    Dataset for non-commercial personal, educational, and academic purposes and rightfully prohibits the uncontrolled redistribution of their data. To comply with Yelp's 
	    Terms of Service, I will not save the Open Dataset or derivates of it in my repository. Instead, please download the Open Dataset directly from 
	    <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset" target="_blank" alt="Yelp Open Dataset">Yelp's Open Dataset</a> website to run the script.</p>

        <p>Near a great forest, there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife and his two children; the boy's name was Hansel, and the girl's name was Gretel. He had little to 
            bite and to break, and once, when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, 
            and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: "What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?"</p>

        <p>"I'll tell you what, husband," answered the woman, "early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, 
		    and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them."<br>
            "No, wife," said the man, "I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces."<br>
            "Oh, you fool!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger; you may as well plane the planks for our coffins," and she left him no peace until he consented.<br> 
		    "But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same," said the man.</p>
