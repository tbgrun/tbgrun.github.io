     <h1 id="overview">Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews</h1>
     <p>Sentiment Analysis uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform unstructured textual data into structured data on user opinions. 
	     Reviews are then classified into positive, negative, or neutral to provide an understanding of the products. The process involves text preprocessing, 
	     feature extraction, and computational modeling to interpret sentiment patterns. Sentiment analysis supports informed decision-making and customer-focus.</p>

        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>    
        <p>Near a great forest, there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife and his two children; the boy's name was Hansel, and the girl's name was Gretel. He had little to bite 
	    and to break, and once, when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and 
	    tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: "What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even 
	    for ourselves?"</p>

        <h1 id="data">Data</h1>    
        <p>In this project, I am using product review data provided by Amazon through the Amazon S3 service. While web scraping could be an effective method for gathering this data, 
	    it is essential to adhere to Amazon's terms of service, which prohibit scraping without prior permission. To comply with both ethical and legal standards, I have 
	    opted to use Amazon's publicly available data, ensuring that all data usage remains within the allowed guidelines. This approach also offers practical benefits, such 
	    as ensuring data consistency and maintaining reproducibility throughout the project.</p>

        <p>The two children, who had also not been able to sleep for hunger, heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: 
	    "Now all is over with us."<br>
	    "Be quiet, Gretel," said Hansel, "do not distress yourself; I will soon find a way to help us."</p>

        <p>And when the old folks had fallen asleep, Hansel got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles 
	    which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could make room for. 
	    Then he went back and said to Gretel: "Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace; God will not forsake us," and he lay down again in his bed.</p>
