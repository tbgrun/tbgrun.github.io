     <h1 id="overview">Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews</h1>
     <p>Sentiment Analysis uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform unstructured textual data into structured data on user opinions. 
	     Reviews are then classified into positive, negative, or neutral to provide an understanding of the products. The process involves text preprocessing, 
	     feature extraction, and computational modeling to interpret sentiment patterns. Sentiment analysis supports informed decision-making and customer-focus.</p>

	<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>    
        <p>Near a great forest, there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife and his two children; the boy's name was Hansel, and the girl's name was Gretel. He had little to bite 
		and to break, and once, when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and 
		tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: "What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even 
		for ourselves?"</p>
    </article>

          <h1 id="data_repository">Data Repository</h1>    
          <p>"I'll tell you what, husband," answered the woman, "early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light 
		  a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we 
		  shall be rid of them."<br>
		  "No, wife," said the man, "I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces."<br>
		  "Oh, you fool!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger; you may as well plane the planks for our coffins," and she left him no peace until he consented. 
		  "But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same," said the man.</p>

          <h1 id="data_analysis">Data Analysis</h1>    
          <p>The two children, who had also not been able to sleep for hunger, heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: 
		  "Now all is over with us."<br>
		  "Be quiet, Gretel," said Hansel, "do not distress yourself; I will soon find a way to help us."</p>
    </article>

          <h1 id="results">Results</h1>    
          <p>And when the old folks had fallen asleep, Hansel got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles 
		  which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could make room for. 
		  Then he went back and said to Gretel: "Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace; God will not forsake us," and he lay down again in his bed.</p>
