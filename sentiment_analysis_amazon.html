     <p>Once upon a time there was a kind girl named Cinderella. She lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters, who treated her poorly. 
       They made her do all the work around the house and gave her the worst room in the attic to sleep in. Despite her hard life, Cinderella 
       remained gentle and kind, always hopeful that her luck would change.</p>

        <p>One day, the King announced that he would hold a grand ball, inviting all the young women in the kingdom so that the Prince could choose a bride. 
          Cinderella's stepsisters were overjoyed and spent hours planning their dresses and hairstyles. But when Cinderella asked if she could go, her 
          stepmother mocked her and said that a dirty girl like her had no place at the ball. Instead, she gave Cinderella even more chores to keep her busy 
          while they prepared for the event.</p>
